h2. Breaking Changes:

* Shared Gateway has been deprecated ("2459":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2459)
* Snappy compression has been deprecated ("2458":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2458)

h2. Upgrade Notes:
 * Upgrading from 0.18 requires issuing a full flush of all the indices in the cluster (@curl host:9200/_flush@) before shutting down the cluster, with no indexing operations happening after the flush.
 * The local gateway state structure has changed from 0.18, a backup of the state files is created when upgrading, they can then be used to downgrade back to 0.18. Don't downgrade without using them.
