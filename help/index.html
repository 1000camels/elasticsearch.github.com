<p>
    There is a strong, helpful community of users on the
    <a href="/community/forum">user mailing list</a>
    and on <a href="/community/#irc">IRC</a>
     who are happy to help you sort out any issues.
</p>

<p>
If something is not working, there are two possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>there is a bug</li>
<li>you are doing something wrong</li>
</ol>


<p>Whichever it is, a <b>clear</b> description of the problem will help other
users to help you.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to <b>gist a simple, complete curl
recreation </b>of the issue. That way, any user can recreate your
problem locally.</p>

<h3>What is a curl recreation?</h3>

<p>
<code>curl</code> is a command line program which can talk to an ElasticSearch
server over http.  All of the code examples in the ElasticSearch
guide are provided as curl statements.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    curl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true'
    {
      "cluster_name" : "MyCluster",
      "status" : "yellow",
      "timed_out" : false,
      "number_of_nodes" : 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
      "active_primary_shards" : 25,
      "active_shards" : 25,
      "relocating_shards" : 0,
      "initializing_shards" : 0,
      "unassigned_shards" : 25
    }
</pre>


<h3>How do I create a curl example?</h3>


<p>
You can just type the command into the command line and copy and
paste the output.
</p>

<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>?pretty=true</code> - it makes it easier to read the output</li>
<li>Change the actual server to <code>localhost:9200</code> or <code>127.0.0.1:9200</code>
rather than <code>elasticsearch.mydomain.com</code> - it makes it easier for
other users to run your example, without having to edit it first.
</li>
<li>It is always better to include your <a href="../guide/reference/mapping/">mapping</a> in the example.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other APIs</h4>
<p>
If you use the Perl API,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~drtech/ElasticSearch/">ElasticSearch.pm</a>,
you can log your commands
in a suitable format:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">
    use ElasticSearch();
    $es = ElasticSearch->new(servers=>'127.0.0.1:9200');

    $es->trace_calls(1);            # log to STDERR
    # $es->trace_calls('example');  # or log to a file

    $es->cluster_health();
</pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    curl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cluster/health'

    # [Sat Feb 12 18:20:42 2011] Response:
    # {
    #    "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
    #    "relocating_shards" : 0,
    #    "active_shards" : 25,
    #    "status" : "yellow",
    #    "cluster_name" : "MyCluster",
    #    "active_primary_shards" : 25,
    #    "timed_out" : false,
    #    "initializing_shards" : 0,
    #    "number_of_nodes" : 1,
    #    "unassigned_shards" : 25
    # }
</pre>


<h3>Why should it be complete?</h3>

<p>
The example should be sufficient to recreate the problem on a new, clean
ElasticSearch server.
</p>
<p>
Quite often, the problem is a result of you having already indexed
data that differs from your current example.
Just by starting from scratch, you may solve your own problem.</p>

<p>If you don't provide all of the information, then it may be
difficult for others to figure out where the issue is.</p>

<h3>Where do I put my curl recreation?</h3>

<p>
Please don't paste long lines of code in the mailing list - it
is difficult to read, and people will be less likely to take the
time to help.
</p>

<p>
You can create a gist on github: <a href="http://gist.github.com/gists">http://gist.github.com/gists</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
"Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository."
</blockquote>

<h3>What other information is useful?</h3>

<p>It is useful to know what version of ElasticSearch you are using.</p>

<p>Depending on the problem, it may also be useful to know:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the version of your JVM</li>
 <li>your local configuration</li>
 <li>your operating system</li>
 <li>how many nodes and indices you have</li>
 <li>what gateway you are using (eg local, fs, s3 etc)</li>
</ul>
