h1. Letter Tokenizer

p. A tokenizer of type @letter@ that divides text at non-letters. That's to say, it defines tokens as maximal strings of adjacent letters. Note, this does a decent job for most European languages, but does a terrible job for some Asian languages, where words are not separated by spaces.
