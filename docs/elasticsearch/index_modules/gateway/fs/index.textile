h1. File System Index Gateway Module

p. The file system index gateway allows to store the content of a shard (actual index + transaction log) on a shared file system.

h2. location

p. The location where the state of an index is stored can be controlled using the @index.gateway.fs.location@ setting. By default, it will be stored under the @work@ directory. Note, the @work@ directory is considered a temporal directory with ElasticSearch (meaning it is safe to @rm -rf@ it), the default location of the persistent gateway in work intentional, *it should be changed*.

p. Explicitly specifying the location for a specific index is certainly possible, and the index will be stored there. More common scenario is to configure the global node level gateway to be "fs":../../../modules/gateway/fs. In this case, the location of the index gateway will automatically use location specified in the node level gateway (with the index name to differentiate between indices).
