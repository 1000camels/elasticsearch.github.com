h1. Hadoop HDFS Index Gateway

p. The Hadoop HDFS index gateway allows to store the content of a shard (actual index + transaction log) on HDFS.

h2. Settings

p. The Hadoop HDFS index gateway worked with the "global HDFS gateway":/docs/elasticsearch/modules/gateway/hadoop. It is used automatically when the global gateway is configured  to use Hadoop, and will automatically use the path configured for the global one. If different path is required for a specific index, it can be set using @index.gateway.hdfs.path@ setting.
