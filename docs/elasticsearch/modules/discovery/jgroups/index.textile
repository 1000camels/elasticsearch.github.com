h1. JGroups Discovery Module

p. "JGroups":http://www.jgroups.org is an excellent group communication library. Though providing many features, only a subset is used which maps to the Discovery module requirements. Namely, using JGroups, different nodes are identified within the cluster (joining and leaving), and JGroups is used for master election.

h2. Configuration

p. JGroups configuration is driven through a configuration file. Surprisingly, the configuration file is not part of the @config@ directory of ElasticSearch. The aim here is to simplify the configuration of JGroups and the configuration files are bundled within ElasticSearch library itself.

p. There are two configurations that comes with ElasticSearch, the @udp@, @tcp@ and @tcp-nio@ (these are the same configuration files the comes with JGroups distribution). Using the @discovery.jgroups.config@ setting, the configuration file can be set. The values can be either @udp@, @tcp@ or @tcp-nio@ (which will then use the embedded configuration files), or the path to an external configuration file.

p. The reason why there is usually no need to mess with the configuration files is because JGroups can be completely configured using system properties. The JGroups discovery module simplifies that a bit and allows to set JGroups level settings using the @discovery.jgroups@ prefix. For example, a common setting to use is to set the @jgroups.bind_addr@ system property. This setting can be set using ElasticSearch configuration by setting @discovery.jgroups.bind_addr@ (same rule applies to all other properties).

p. A good source to JGroups configuration can be found on its "wiki":http://community.jboss.org/wiki/jgroups.
