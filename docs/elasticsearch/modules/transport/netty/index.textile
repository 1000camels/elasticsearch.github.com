h1. Netty Transport Module

p. "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty is an excellent asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The netty transport implementation utilizes it in order to provide high performance, asynchronous based TCP communication.

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|port|A bind port range. Defaults to @9300-9400@.|
|bindHost|The bind host. Defaults to the "network level settings":../../node/network.|
|publishHost|The publish host. This is the host that other nodes will use to connect to this node. Defaults to the "network level settings":../../node/network.|
|connectTimeout|The socket connect timeout setting (in time setting format). Defaults to @1s@.|
|connectRetries|The number of connect retries to a node. Defaults to @2@.|
|connectionsPerNode|The number of open connections from this node to another node. Defaults to @5@|
|workerCount|The number of worker threads to use. Defaults to the number of available processors.|
|tcpNoDelay|Enable or disable tcp no delay setting. Defaults to @true@.|
|tcpKeepAlive|Enable or disable tcp keep alive. By default not explicitly set.|
|reuseAddress|Should an address be reused or not. Defaults to @true@.|
|tcpSendBufferSize|The size of the tcp send buffer size (in size setting format). By default not explicitly set.|
|tcpReceiveBufferSize|The size of the tcp receive buffer size (in size setting format). By default not explicitly set.|
