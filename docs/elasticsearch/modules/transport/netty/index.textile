h1. Netty Transport Module

p. "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty is an excellent asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The netty transport implementation utilizes it in order to provide high performance, asynchronous based TCP communication.

|@connect_timeout@|The socket connect timeout setting (in time setting format). Defaults to @1s@.|
|@connect_retries@|The number of connect retries to a node. Defaults to @2@.|
|@connections_per_node@|The number of open connections from this node to another node. Defaults to @5@|
|@worker_count@|The number of worker threads to use. Defaults to the number of available processors.|
|@tcp_no_delay@|Enable or disable tcp no delay setting. Defaults to @true@.|
|@tcp_keep_alive@|Enable or disable tcp keep alive. By default not explicitly set.|
|@reuse_address@|Should an address be reused or not. Defaults to @true@.|
