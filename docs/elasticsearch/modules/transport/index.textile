h1. Transport Module

p. The transport module is used for internal communication between nodes within the cluster. Each call that goes from one node to the other uses the transport module (for example, when an HTTP GET request is processed by one node, and should actually be processed by another node that holds the data).

p. The transport mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using asynchronous communication is first solving the "C10k problem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem, as well as being the idle solution for scatter (broadcast) / gather operations such as search in ElasticSearch.

p. The transport module is an abstraction on top of an actual implementation of transport. The following transports are supported:
