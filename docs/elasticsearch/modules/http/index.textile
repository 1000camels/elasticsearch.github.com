h1. HTTP Module

p. The http module is allows to expose ElasticSearch API over HTTP.

p. The http mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using asynchronous communication for HTTP is solving the "C10k problem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem.

p. When possible, consider using "HTTP keep alive":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive#HTTP_Keepalive when connecting for better performance.

p. The http module is an abstraction on top of an actual implementation of http. The following are supported:

|_. Type |_. Description |
|"netty":netty|An http implementation using "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty.|

h2. Settings

p. The http module can be completely disabled and not started using by setting @http.enabled@ to @false@. This make sense when creating non "data nodes":../node/data_node which accept HTTP requests, and communicate with data nodes using the internal "transport":../transport.
