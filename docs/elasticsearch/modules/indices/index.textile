h1. Indices Module

p. The indices module allow to control settings that are globally managed for all indices.

h2. Indexing Buffer

p. The indexing buffer setting allows to control how much memory will be allocated for the indexing process. It is a global setting that bubbles down to all the different shards allocated on a specific node.

p. The @indices.memory.index_buffer_size@ accepts either a percentage or a byte size value. It defaults to @10%@, meaning that @10%@ of the total memory allocated to a node will be used as the indexing buffer size. This amount is then divided between all the different shards.

p. The @indices.memory.min_shard_index_buffer_size@ allows to set a hard lower limit for the memory allocated per shard for its own indexing buffer. It defaults to @4mb@.
