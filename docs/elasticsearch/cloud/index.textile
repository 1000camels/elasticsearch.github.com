h1. Cloud

p. ElasticSearch provides native integration with the "cloud" using the cloud plugin. The integration allows to perform native "discovery":discvoery using the cloud compute API (such as Amazon EC2 or Rackspace CloudServers), and storing the "gateway":gateway on cloud providers blob stores (such as Amazon S3 or Rackspace CloudFiles).

p. Installing the plugin (which downloads the cloud plugin and installs it under the @plugins@ directory) is done using:

<pre class="prettyprint">
bin/plugin install cloud
</pre>
