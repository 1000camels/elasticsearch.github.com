h1. Root Object Type

p. The root object mapping is an "object type mapping":../object_type that maps the root object (the type itself). On top of all the different mappings that can be set using the "object type mapping":../object_type, it allows for additional, type level mapping definitions.

p. The root object mapping allows to index a JSON document that either starts with the actual mapping type, or only contains its fields. For example, the following @tweet@ JSON can be indexed:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" {
        "message" : "This is a tweet!"
    }
}
</pre>

p. But, also the following JSON can be indexed:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "message" : "This is a tweet!"
}
</pre>

p. The above can be done since the API for the index operation already includes the type the JSON document belongs to.

h2. Special Fields

p. Each document created has special fields that are either created or managed automatically, with specific mappings allowing to control their behavior. The fields are:

|_. Field | Description |
|"_id":../id_field|Allow to control the automatically created @_id@ field.|
|"_type":../type_field|Allow to control the automatically created @_type@ field.|
|"_boost":../boost_field|Allow to control the boosting of a document using an external value.|
|"_source":../source_field|Allow to control the @_source@ field storing the actual JSON indexed.|
|"_all":../all_field|Allows to automatically create an @_all@ field that includes all the other fields.|

h2. Index / Search Analyzers

p. The root object allows to define type mapping level analyzers for index and search that will be used with all different fields that do not explicitly set analyzers on their own. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "index_analyzer" : "standard",
        "search_analyzer" : "standard"
    }
}
</pre>

p. The above simply explicitly defines both the @index_analyzer@ and @search_analyzer@ that will be used. There is also an option to use the @analyzer@ attribute to set both the @search_analyzer@ and @index_analyzer@.
