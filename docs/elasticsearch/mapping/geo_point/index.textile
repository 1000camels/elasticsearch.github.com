h1. Geo Point Type

p. Mapper type called @geo_point@ to support geo based points. The declaration looks as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "properties" : {
            "location" : {
                "type" : "geo_point"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Input Structure

The above mapping defines a @geo_point@, which accepts different formats. The following formats are supported:

h3. Lat Lon as Properties

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : {
            "lat" : 40.12,
            "lon" : -71.34
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h3. Lat Lon as String

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : "41.12,-71.34"
    }
}
</pre>

h3. Geohash

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : "drm3btev3e86"
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Lat Lon as Array

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : [41.12, -71.34]
    }
}
</pre>


h2. Indexed Fields

The @geo_point@ type creates two floating point fields, called @lat@ and @lon@. In our example above, two fields will be create, the first @location.lat@ and the second is @location.lon@. Though probably not needed, there is an option also to create a third field called @geohash@ with the @geohash@ value (represented as @location.geohash@). In most cases, those specific fields are not needed when using geo capabilities, and only @location@ will be needed (for example, with @geo_distance@ filter).

h2. Mapping Options

|_. Option |_. Description |
|@resolution@|Controls the floating point resolution of the stored fields. Defaults to 64, but can also be 32.|
|@geohash@|Set to true to store also the geohash in the index. defaults to false.|
|@geohash_precision@|Sets the geohash precision, defaults to 12.|
