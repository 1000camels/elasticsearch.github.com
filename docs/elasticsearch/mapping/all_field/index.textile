h1. All Field

p. The idea of an @_all@ field is a field that includes the text of one or more other fields within the document indexed. It can come very handy especially for search request, where we want to execute a search query against the content of a document, without knowing which fields to search on. This comes at the expense of CPU cycles and index size.

p. The @_all@ fields can be completely disabled. Explicit field mapping and object mapping can be excluded / included in the all field. By default, all field is enabled and all fields are included in it for ease of use.

p. One of the nice features of the @_all@ field is that it takes into account specific fields boost levels. Meaning that if a title field is boosted more than content, the title (part) in the @_all@ field will mean more than the content (part) in the @_all@ field.

p. Here is a sample mapping:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "person" : {
        "_all" : {"enabled" : true},
        "properties" : {
            "name" : {
                "type" : "object",
                "dynamic" : false,
                "properties" : {
                    "first" : {"type" : "string", "store" : "yes", "include_in_all" : false},
                    "last" : {"type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed"}
                }
            },
            "address" : {
                "type" : "object",
                "include_in_all" : false,
                "properties" : {
                    "first" : {
                        "properties" : {
                            "location" : {"type" : "string", "store" : "yes", "index_name" : "firstLocation"}
                        }
                    },
                    "last" : {
                        "properties" : {
                            "location" : {"type" : "string"}
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "simple1" : {"type" : "long", "include_in_all" : true},
            "simple2" : {"type" : "long", "include_in_all" : false}
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @_all@ fields allows for @store@, @term_vector@ and @analyzer@ (with specific @index_analyzer@ and @search_analyzer@) to be set.
