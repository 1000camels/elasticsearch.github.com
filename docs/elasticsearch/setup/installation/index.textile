h1. Installation

p. After "downloading":/products/download the latest release, extracting it, ElasticSearch can be started using:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
$ bin/elasticsearch
</pre>

Under *nix system, the command will start the process in the background. To run it in the foreground, add the -f switch to it:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
$ bin/elasticsearch -f
</pre>

ElasticSearch is built using Java, and requires "Java 6":http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp in order to run. The version of Java that will be used can be set by setting the @JAVA_HOME@ environment variable.

h2. Environment Variables

p. Within the scripts, ElasticSearch comes with built in @JAVA_OPTS@ passed to the JVM started. The most important setting for that is the @-Xmx@ to control the maximum allowed memory for the process, and @-Xms@ to control the minimum allocated memory for the process (_in general, the more memory allocated to the process, the better_).

p. In general it is better to leave the default @JAVA_OPTS@ as they are, and use the @ES_JAVA_OPTS@ environment variable in order to set / change JVM settings or arguments.

h3. *NIX

p. There are added features when using the @elasticsearch@ shell script. The first, which was explained earlier, is the ability to easily run the process either in the foreground or the background.

p. Another feature is the ability to pass @-X@ and @-D@ directly to the script. When set, both override anything set using either @JAVA_OPTS@ or @ES_JAVA_OPTS@. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
$ bin/elasticsearch -f -Xmx2g -Xms2g -Des.index.storage.type=memory
</pre>
