h1. Directory Layout

p. The directory layout of an installation is as follows:

p. *- bin*: Binary scripts including @elasticsearch@ to start a node. See more at the "installation":../installation page.

p. *- config*: Configuration files including @elasticsearch.yml@. See more at the "configuration":../configuration page.

p. *- work*: Temporal files that are used by different nodes. For example, the local file system based storage of each shard index information (under a unique path including the node id, index name, and shard id), as well as the logs.
