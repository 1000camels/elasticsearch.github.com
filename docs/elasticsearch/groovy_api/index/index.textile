h1. Index

p. The index API is very similar to the "Java index API":/docs/elasticsearch/java_api/index. The Groovy extension to it is the ability to provide the indexed source using a closure. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
def indexR = client.index {
    index "test"
    type "type1"
    id "1"
    source {
        test = "value"
        complex {
            value1 = "value1"
            value2 = "value2"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. In the above example, the source closure itself gets transformed into an XContent (defaults to JSON). In order to change how the source closure is serialized, a global (static) setting can be set on the @GClient@ by changing the @indexContentType@ field.

p. Note also that the @source@ can be set using the typical Java based APIs, the @Closure@ option is a Groovy extension.
