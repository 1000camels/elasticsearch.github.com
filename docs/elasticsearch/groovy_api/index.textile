h1. Groovy API

p. This section describes the "Groovy":http://groovy.codehaus.org/ API elasticsearch provides. All of elasticsearch APIs are executed using a "GClient":client, and are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a listener, or return a future).

p. The Groovy API is a wrapper on top of the "Java API":/docs/elasticsearch/java_api exposing it in a groovier manner. The execution options for each API follow a similar manner and covered in "the anatomy of a Groovy API":anatomy. The following section lists more detailed explanation of the more common APIs:

|_. API |_. Description |
|"index":index|Index a typed JSON document into a specific index and make it searchable.|
|"delete":delete|Delete a typed JSON document from a specific index based on its id.|
|"get":get|Get a typed JSON document from an index based on its id.|
|"search":search|Execute a search query against one or more indices and get back search hits.|
|"count":count|Execute a query against one or more indices and get hits count.|

h2. Maven Repository

p. ElasticSearch is hosted on "Sonatype":http://www.sonatype.org/, with both a "releases repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and a "snapshots repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots.
