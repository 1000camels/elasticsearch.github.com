h1. Body Request

p. The search request can be executed with a search DSL, which includes the "Query DSL":../../query_dsl, within its body. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search' -d '
{
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
    }
}
'
</pre>

p. And here is a sample response:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "_shards":{
        "total" : 5,
        "successful" : 5,
        "failed" : 0
    },
    "hits":{
        "total" : 1,
        "hits" : [
            {
                "_index" : "twitter",
                "_type" : "tweet",
                "_id" : "1", 
                "_source" : {
                    "user" : "kimchy",
                    "postDate" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
                    "message" : "trying out Elastic Search"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
</pre>


h2. Parameters

|_. Name |_. Description |
| @from@ | The starting from index of the hits to return. Defaults to @0@. |
| @size@ | The number of hits to return. Defaults to @10@. |
| @search_type@ | The type of the search operation to perform. Can be @dfs_query_then_fetch@, @dfs_query_and_fetch@, @query_then_fetch@, @query_and_fetch@. Defaults to @query_then_fetch@. |

p. Out of the above, the @search_type@ is the one that can not be passed within the search request body, and in order to set it, it must be passed as a request REST parameter.

p. The rest of the search request should be passed within the body itself. The body content can also be passed as a REST parameter named @source@.

p(note). Both HTTP GET and HTTP POST can be used to execute search with body. Since not all clients support GET with body, POST is allowed as well.
