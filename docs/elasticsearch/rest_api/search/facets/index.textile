h1. Facets

p. Facets allow to provide aggregated data based on the search request. For example, a facet can return the most popular terms within the search query.

|_. Facet |_. Description |
|"query":query_facet|A facet returning a count matching the facet query.|
|"terms":terms_facet|A facet returning the N most frequent terms.|
|"histogram":histogram_facet|A histogram facet across numeric fields.|
|"statistical":statistical_facet|Compute statistical data for numeric fields or scripts.|

h2. global

p. All facets can be configured to either executed globally (not bounded by the search query), or not (bounded by the search query). By default, facets are not global. Setting a facet to run globally can be done using:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "facets" : {
        "wow_facet" : {
            "facet_type" : {
                ...
            },
            "global" : true
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

h2. filter

p. All facets can be configured with an additional filter (explained in the "Query DSL":../../query_dsl#Filters section), which will further reduce the documents they execute on. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "facets" : {
        "wow_facet" : {
            "facet_type" : {
                ...
            },
            "filter" : {
                "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>
