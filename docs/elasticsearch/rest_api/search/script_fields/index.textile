h1. Script Fields

p. Allows to return a "script evaluation":../../../modules/scripting (based on different fields) for each hit, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "query" : {
        ...
    },
    "script_fields" : {
        "test1" : {
            "script" : "doc['my_field_name'].value * 2"
        },
        "test2" : {
            "script" : "doc['my_field_name'].value * factor",
            "params" : {
                "factor"  : 2.0
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. Script fields can work on fields that are not store (@my_field_name@ in the above case), and allow to return custom values to be returned (the evaluated value of the script).

p. Though very handy, script fields should not be used for analyzed fields, only for non analyzed and single term fields (which include numeric fields). They do come at a cost of added memory usage for the fields used within the script (but shared if they are used for sorting / faceting, which uses the same mechanism).
