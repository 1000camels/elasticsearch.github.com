h1. And Filter

p. A filter that matches documents using @AND@ boolean operator on other queries. This filter is more performant then "bool":../bool_filter filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "name.first" : "shay" }
        },
        "filter" : {
            "and" : [
                {
                    "range" : { 
                        "postDate" : { 
                            "from" : "2010-03-01",
                            "to" : "2010-04-01"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "prefix" : { "name.second" : "ba" }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Caching

p. The result of the filter is not cached by default. The `_cache` can be set to `true` in order to cache it (tough usually not needed).
