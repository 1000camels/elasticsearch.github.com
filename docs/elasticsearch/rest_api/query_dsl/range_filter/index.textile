h1. Range Filter

p. Filters documents with fields that have terms within a certain range. Similar to range query, except that it acts as a filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constantScore" : {
        "filter" : {
            "range" : {
                "age" : { 
                    "from" : "10", 
                    "to" : "20", 
                    "include_lower" : true, 
                    "include_upper" : false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @range@ filter top level parameters include:

|_. Name |_. Description |
| @from@ | The lower bound. Defaults to start from the first.|
| @to@ | The upper bound. Defaults to unbounded. |
| @from_inclusive@ | Should the first from (if set) be inclusive or not. Defaults to @true@ |
| @to_inclusive@ | Should the last to (if set) be inclusive or not. Defaults to @true@. |
| @gt@ | Same as setting @from@ and @from_inclusive@ to @false@. |
| @gte@ | Same as setting @from@ and @from_inclusive@ to @true@. |
| @lt@ | Same as setting @to@ and @to_inclusive@ to @false@. |
| @lte@ | Same as setting @to@ and @to_inclusive@ to @true@. |
