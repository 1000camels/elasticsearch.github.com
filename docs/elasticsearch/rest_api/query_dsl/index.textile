h1. Query DSL

p. ElasticSearch provides a full query dsl based on JSON to define queries. In general, there are basic queries such as @term@ or @prefix@. There are also compound queries like the @bool@ query. Queries can also have filters associated with them such as the @filtered@ or @constant_score@ queries, with specific filter queries. 

p(note). Filters are very handy since they perform an order of magnitude better then plain queries since no scoring is required and they are automatically cached.

|"bool":bool_query|A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.|
|"dis_max":dis_max_query|A query that generates the union of documents produced by its subqueries, and that scores each document with the maximum score for that document as produced by any subquery, plus a tie breaking increment for any additional matching subqueries.|
|"constant_score":constant_score_query|A query that wraps a filter and simply returns a constant score equal to the query boost for every document in the filter.|
