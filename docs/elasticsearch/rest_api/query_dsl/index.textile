h1. Query DSL

p. ElasticSearch provides a full query dsl based on JSON to define queries. In general, there are basic queries such as @term@ or @prefix@. There are also compound queries like the @bool@ query. Queries can also have filters associated with them such as the @filtered@ or @constant_score@ queries, with specific filter queries. 

p(note). Filters are very handy since they perform an order of magnitude better then plain queries since no scoring is required and they are automatically cached.

h2. Queries

|_. API |_. Description |
|"term":term_query|Matches documents that have fields that contain a a term (*not analyzed*).|
|"range":range_query|Matches documents with fields that have terms within a certain range.|
|"prefix":prefix_query|Matches documents that have fields containing terms with a specified prefix.|
|"wildcard":wildcard_query|Matches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression.|
|"fuzzy":fuzzy_query|A fuzzy based query that uses similarity based on Levenshtein (edit distance) algorithm.|
|"match_all":match_all_query|A query that matches all documents.|
|"query_string":query_string_query|A query that uses a query parser in order to parse a query string.|
|"field":field_query|A query that executes a query string against a specific field.|
|"bool":bool_query|A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.|
|"dis_max":dis_max_query|A query that generates the union of documents produced by its subqueries, and that scores each document with the maximum score for that document as produced by any subquery, plus a tie breaking increment for any additional matching subqueries.|
|"constant_score":constant_score_query|A query that wraps a filter and simply returns a constant score equal to the query boost for every document in the filter.|
|"filtered":filtered_query|A query that applies a filter to the results of another query.|
|"more_like_this":more_like_this_query|More like this query find documents that are "like" provided text by running it against one or more fields.|

|"fuzzy_like_this":fuzzy_like_this_query|Fuzzy like this query find documents that are "like" provided text by running it against one or more fields.|
|"fuzzy_like_this_field":fuzzy_like_this_field_query|Fuzzy like this query find documents that are "like" provided text by running it against a field.|
|"span_term":span_term_query|Matches spans containing a term.|
|"span_first":span_first_query|Matches spans near the beginning of a field.|
|"span_near":span_near_query|Matches spans which are near one another.|
|"span_not":span_not_query|Removes matches which overlap with another span query.|
|"span_or":span_or_query|Matches the union of its span query clauses.|
|"custom_score":custom_score_query|Wraps another query and provides custom scripted score computation.|
