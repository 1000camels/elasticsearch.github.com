h1. Query DSL

p. ElasticSearch provides a full query dsl based on JSON to define queries. In general, there are basic queries such as @term@ or @prefix@. There are also compound queries like the @bool@ query. Queries can also have filters associated with them such as the @filteredQuery@ or @constantScore@ queries, with specific filter queries. 

p(note). Filters are very handy since they perform an order of magnitude better then plain queries since no scoring is required and they are automatically cached by ElasticSearch.

|_. API |_. Description |
|"term":term_query|Matches documents that have fields that contain a a term (*not analyzed*).|

|"wildcard":wildcard_query|Matches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression.|
|"matchAll":matchAll_query|A query that matches all documents.|

|"field":field_query|A query that executes a query string against a specific field.|
|"bool":bool_query|A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.|
|"disMax":disMax_query|A query that generates the union of documents produced by its subqueries, and that scores each document with the maximum score for that document as produced by any subquery, plus a tie breaking increment for any additional matching subqueries.|
|"constantScore":constantScore_query|A query that wraps a filter and simply returns a constant score equal to the query boost for every document in the filter.|
|"filtered":filtered_query|A query that applies a filter to the results of another query.|
