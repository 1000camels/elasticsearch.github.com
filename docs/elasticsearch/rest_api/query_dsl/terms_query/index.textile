h1. Terms Query

p. A query that match on any (configurable) of the provided terms. This is a simpler syntax query for using a @bool@ query with several @term@ queries in the @should@ clauses. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "terms" : {
        "tags" : [ "blue", "pill" ]
        "minimum_match" : 1
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @terms@ query is also aliased with @in@ as the query name for simpler usage.
