h1. Terms Filter

p. Filters documents that have fields that match any of the provided terms (*not analyzed*). For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "terms" : { "user" : ["kimchy", "elasticsearch"]}
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @terms@ filter is also aliased with @in@ as the filter name for simpler usage.

h2. Optimization

p. Note, if the terms tend to repeat in other @term@ or @terms@ filter, it is considered better to have a an @or@ filter wrapping single @term@ filters. 

h2. Caching

p. The result of the filter is automatically cached by default. The `_cache` can be set to `false` to turn it off.
