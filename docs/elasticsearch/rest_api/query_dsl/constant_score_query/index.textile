h1. Constant Score Query

p. A query that wraps a filter and simply returns a constant score equal to the query boost for every document in the filter. Maps to Lucene @ConstantScoreQuery@.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
        },
        "boost" : 1.2
    }
}
</pre>

p. The filter object can hold only filter elements, not queries. Filters are much faster compared to queries since they don't perform any scoring, and they are cached within ElasticSearch.
