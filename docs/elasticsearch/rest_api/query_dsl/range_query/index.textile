h1. Range Query

p. Matches documents with fields that have terms within a certain range. The type of the Lucene query depends on the field type, for @string@ fields, the @TermRangeQuery@, while for number/date fields, the query is a @NumericRangeQuery@. The following example returns all documents where @age@ is between @10@ and @20@:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "range" : {
        "age" : { 
            "from" : 10, 
            "to" : 20, 
            "include_lower" : true, 
            "include_upper": false, 
            "boost" : 2.0
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @range@ query top level parameters include:

|_. Name |_. Description |
| @from@ | The lower bound. Defaults to start from the first.|
| @to@ | The upper bound. Defaults to unbounded. |
| @from_inclusive@ | Should the first from (if set) be inclusive or not. Defaults to @true@ |
| @to_inclusive@ | Should the last to (if set) be inclusive or not. Defaults to @true@. |
| @gt@ | Same as setting @from@ and @from_inclusive@ to @false@. |
| @gte@ | Same as setting @from@ and @from_inclusive@ to @true@. |
| @lt@ | Same as setting @to@ and @to_inclusive@ to @false@. |
| @lte@ | Same as setting @to@ and @to_inclusive@ to @true@. |
| @boost@ | Sets the boost value of the query. Defaults to @1.0@. |
