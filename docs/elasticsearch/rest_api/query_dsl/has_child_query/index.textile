h1. Has Child Query

p. The @has_child@ query works the same as the "has_child":../has_child_filter filter, by automatically wrapping the filter with a "constant_score":../constant_score_query. It has the same syntax as the "has_child":../has_child_filter filter:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "has_child" : {
        "type" : "blog_tag"
        "query" : {
            "term" : {
                "tag" : "something"
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

h2. Scope

p. A @_scope@ can be defined on the filter allowing to run facets on the same scope name that will work against the child documents. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "has_child" : {
        "_scope" : "my_scope",
        "type" : "blog_tag"
        "query" : {
            "term" : {
                "tag" : "something"
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

h2. Memory Considerations

p. With the current implementation, all @_id@ values are loaded to memory (heap) in order to support fast lookups, so make sure there is enough mem for it.
