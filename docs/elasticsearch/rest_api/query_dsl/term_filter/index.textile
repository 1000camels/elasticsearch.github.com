h1. Term Filter

p. Filters documents that have fields that contain a a term (*not analyzed*). Similar to term query, except that it acts as a filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constantScore" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
        },
    }
}
</pre>
