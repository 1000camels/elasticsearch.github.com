h1. Open / Close

p. The open and close index APIs allow to close an index, and later on opening it. A closed index has almost no overhead on the cluster (except for maintaining its metadata), and is blocked for read/write operations. A closed index can be opened which will then go through the normal recovery process.

p. The REST endpoint is @/{index}/_close@ and @/{index}/_open@. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/my_index/_close'

curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/my_index/_open'
</pre>
