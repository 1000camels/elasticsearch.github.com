h1. Refresh

p. The refresh API allows to explicitly refresh an one or more index, making all operations performed since the last refresh available for search. The (near) real-time capabilities depends on the index engine used. For example, the robin one requires refresh to be called, but by default a refresh is scheduled periodically.

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/twitter/_refresh
</pre>

h2. Multi Index

p. The refresh API can be applied to more than one index with a single call, or even on @_all@ the indices.

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/kimchy,elasticsearch/_refresh

$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_refresh
</pre>
