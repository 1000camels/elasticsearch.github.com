h1. Delete

p. The delete API allows to delete a typed JSON document from a specific index based on its id. The following example deletes the JSON document from an index called twitter, under a type called tweet, with id valued 1:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
import static org.elasticsearch.client.Requests.*;

DeleteResponse response = client.delete(deleteRequest("twitter")
        .type("tweet")
        .id("1")).actionGet();
</pre>

p. For more information on the index operation, check out the REST "delete":/docs/elasticsearch/rest_api/delete docs.
