h1. Admin API

p. The Java admin API provides exactly the same functionality as the REST "admin":/docs/elasticsearch/rest_api/admin with all the different methods. Getting the indices admin is done using @Client#admin()#indices()@, and the cluster admin is done using @Client#admin()#cluster()@.

p. Using the API follows the same principals as the other main APIs, and its parameters and usage have full javadoc.
