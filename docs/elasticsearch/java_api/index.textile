h1. Java API

p. This section describes the Java API elasticsearch provides. All of elasticsearch APIs are executed using a "Client":client, and are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a listener, or return a future).

|_. API |_. Description |
|"index":index|Index a typed JSON document into a specific index and make it searchable.|
|"delete":delete|Delete a typed JSON document from a specific index based on its id.|
|"get":get|Get a typed JSON document from an index based on its id.|
|"search":search|Execute a search query against one or more indices and get back search hits.|
|"count":count|Execute a query against one or more indices and get hits count.|
|"terms":terms|Extract terms and their document frequencies from one or more fields.|

p. There is also an evolving "Administration Java API":admin.


h2. Maven Repository

p. ElasticSearch is hosted on "Sonatype":http://www.sonatype.org/, with both a "releases repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and a "snapshots repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots.

p. It requires the "jboss repo":https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/ to be added as well.
