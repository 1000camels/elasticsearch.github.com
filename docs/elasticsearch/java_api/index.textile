|_. API |_. Description |
|"index":index|Index a typed JSON document into a specific index and make it searchable.|
|"delete":delete|Delete a typed JSON document from a specific index based on its id.|
|"get":get|Get a typed JSON document from an index based on its id.|
|"search":search|Execute a search query against one or more indices and get back search hits.|
|"count":count|Execute a query against one or more indices and get hits count.|
|"terms":terms|Extract terms and their document frequencies from one or more fields.|

p. There is also an evolving "Administration Java API":admin.
