p. The docs are maintained on *elasticsearch* "github wiki":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/wiki, and are community driven. Aside from the reference docs, writing Tutorials, Getting Started, and other pieces of information are of the utmost value for the community.

p. If you can go public with your project and the fact that it uses *elasticsearch*, make sure to update the "Powered By":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/wiki/Powered-By section. If you wrote a client or an integration with *elasticsearch*, make sure to update "Clients And Integrations":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/wiki/Clients-And-Integrations.
