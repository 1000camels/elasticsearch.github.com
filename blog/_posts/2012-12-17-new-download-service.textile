p. Elasticsearch has been using Github's static downloads feature as a means of distributing releases for both the core and its plugins for a few years now.  Unfortunately, last week, "Github stopped supporting downloads":https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads.  We've been working the past few days to replace this functionality internally.

p. All of the links to elasticsearch core have been updated to the new site through @download.elasticsearch.org@.  We're still migrating our plugins, so you'll see those change in the next day or two.  We are still working on a solution for third-party plugins.

p.  The old assets will be removed tomorrow, so if you're using any @github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/*@ links in your provisioning system please update them to the commensurate @download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/*@.
