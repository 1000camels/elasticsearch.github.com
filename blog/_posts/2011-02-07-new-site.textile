p. We have revamped the site look and feel, hopefully to make it more appealing and more expressive in explaining what *elasticsearch* is all about. There is still much work left to be done, but we are on it!.

p. The first aim was to get a "single pager" listing the most important things *elasticsearch* is about in the front page. An effort to create a more formalized "guide":/guide has taken place and you should see more content starting to appear in it.

p. Another effort is to try and get the community more involved in expanding the knowledge based around *elasticsearch*. This site itself is hosted on Github, and can be easily extended with new "tutorials":/tutorials, "videos":/videos, or even helping out on writing the "guide":/guide. "Contributing":/community/contributing-site.html is simple, and the community will be grateful for it.

p. As a side note, in an effort to make contributions more simpler, I went ahead and migrated most of the docs to the Github wiki, only to realize that it has some very basic deficiencies (its not possible to follow the fork / send pull request idiom for example)... . So, all the docs were converted back to the site. That made for a fun weekend :).
