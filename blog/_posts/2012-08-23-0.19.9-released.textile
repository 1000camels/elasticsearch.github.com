p. *elasticsearch* version @0.19.9@ is out. You can download it "here":/download. It contains several bug fixes but also new features, including:

h2. Snappy Compression

p. New experimental support for @snappy@ compression on top of the current @lzf@. Changing to use it is as simple as setting @compress.default.type@ to @snappy@. Note, anything already compressed with @lzf@ will still work correctly.

h2. @text@ renamed to @match@

p. The @text@ query name gave it great injustice, as it nicely also handles dates and numeric types as well for example. It was renamed to @match@ in order to better reflect what it actually does, with backward support for the @text@ name as well.

p. On top of that there is now support for "multi_match":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2153 query, allowing to more easily run @match@ queries on several fields without the verbosity of using @bool@ query to wrap it.

h2. Explain API

p. New API called "explain":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2184, allowing to easily check how and why a specific document matches a query, or even understand why a specific document does not match a specific query.

h2. Networking Enhacements

p. Several networking enhancements geared towards reducing further the amount of buffer copies while doing network operations, and better defaults for network buffer sizes.
