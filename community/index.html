<h1>Mailing List</h1>

<p>
    <a href="/community/forum">user mailing list</a> is where <strong>elasticsearch</strong> users come to <em>seek help, announce projects, and discuss</em> all kind of matters surrounding the <strong>elasticsearch</strong> and the community.
</p>
<p>
    You need to <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/elasticsearch.com/group/users/subscribe">register</a> with your google account to the list. At the bottom of left side pane, enter your google account user (email) continue with the login process.
</p>

<h1>Twitter &amp; Blog</h1>

<p>
    Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/elasticsearch">@elasticsearch</a> on twitter, and subscribe to the <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
</p>

<h1>IRC</h1>

<p>
    Sometimes its just easier to get help or discuss matters in real time. The <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/elasticsearch">#elasticsearch</a> channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em> allows for just that (<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat.freenode</a>). Note: IRC discussions tend to exclude large parts of the community. Therefore elasticsearch core technical discussions and decisions must take place on the mailing lists, not IRC. They don't count otherwise.
</p>
