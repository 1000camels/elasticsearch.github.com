p. There are many places where the *elasticsearch* community (you!) would love for people to contribute, one of them is enhancing the knowledge base around *elasticsearch*. The site itself is hosted on "github":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.github.com and adding content to it is just a fork away.

p. Interesting places to start is to write a "tutorial":/tutorials about your usage of *elasticsearch*, or maybe record a short "video":/videos showing how you use it. Another is to fix and enhance the *elasticsearch* "guide":/guide.

p. Once the repo is forked / cloned, writing content is pretty simple with many examples already there. For example, if you are writing a tutorial, just start from an existing one. Don't worry about getting everything right, the content is what matters, we are here to help with the rest.

p. If you want to "build" the site, "jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll is used to generate it. Once you "installed":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install it, just run @jekyll --server@ to get the site running and head over to @localhost:4000@.
