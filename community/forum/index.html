    <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/elasticsearch">elasticsearch on Google Groups</a> is where elasticsearch users come to <em>seek help, announce projects, and discuss</em> all kind of matters surrounding the framework and the community.
</p>
<p>
	The group was previously hosted <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/elasticsearch.com/group/users/">here</a> and moved on July 24, 2011. Some users have been automatically imported to the new group, if you are not a member, make sure to join.

	Below you can find an embedded nabble mirror of the mailing list. You still need to register to the google group mailing list in order to post. Note, Nabble seems to not always post messages to the mailing list, so make sure to post directly through google groups.
