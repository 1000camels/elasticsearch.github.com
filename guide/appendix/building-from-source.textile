p. *elasticsearch* codebase is hosted on "github":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch, and its just a @fork@ away. To get started with the code, start by either forking or cloning the repo. One can also just download the master code in either "zip":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/zipball/master or "tar.gz":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/tarball/master.

p. Once downloaded, building an elasticsearch distribution is simple. You'll need "Apache Maven":http://maven.apache.org/download.html
or see below for IDE integration. Then compile ElasticSearch via:

<pre class="prettify">
$ mvn package -DskipTests
</pre>

p. If you are running it for the first time, go get a cup of coffee (or better yet, a beer), it will take some time to download all the dependencies *elasticsearch* has. Once finished, a full distribution of the elasticsearch will be created under @target/releases/@.

p. In order to use it, just get either the @deb@ package, the @zip@ or @tar.gz@ installation, extract it, and fire up @elasticsearch -f@. You now have a fully functional master based *elasticsearch* version running.
