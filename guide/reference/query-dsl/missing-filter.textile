p. Filters documents where a specific field has no value in them.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "missing" : { "field" : "user" }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. By defualt, the filter will only find "missing" fields, i.e., fields that have no values. It can be configured also to find fields with an explicit @null_value@ mapped for them. Here is an example that will both find missing field that don't exists (@existance@ set to @true@), or have null values (@null_value@ set to @true@).

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "missing" : { 
                "field" : "user",
                "existence" : true,
                "null_value" : true
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>


h1. Caching

p. The result of the filter is always cached.
