p. A @custom_filters_score@ query allows to execute a query, and if the hit matches a provided filter (ordered), use the script associated with it to compute the score. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "custom_filters_score" : {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "filters" : [
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 0, "to" : 10} } },
                "script" : "_score * 3"
            },
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 10, "to" : 20} } },
                "script" : "_score * 2"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</pre>

p. This can considerably simplify and increase performance for parameterized based scoring since filters are easily cached for faster performance, and the script is considerably simpler.

p. The query allows (on the same level as @query@ and @filters@) to provide @boost@, and the common scripting elements @params@ and @lang@.
