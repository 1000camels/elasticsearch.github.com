p. Filters documents that have fields that match any of the provided terms (*not analyzed*). For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "terms" : { "user" : ["kimchy", "elasticsearch"]}
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @terms@ filter is also aliased with @in@ as the filter name for simpler usage.

h2. Execution Mode

p. The way terms filter executes is by iterating over the terms provided and finding matches docs (loading into a bitset) and caching it. Sometimes, we want a different execution model that can still be achieved by building more complex queries in the DSL, but we can support them in the more compact model that terms filter provides.

p. The @execution@ option now has the following options :

* @plain@: The default. Works as today. Iterates over all the terms, building a bit set matching it, and filtering. The total filter is cached.
* @bool@: Generates a term filter (which is cached) for each term, and wraps those in a bool filter. The bool filter itself is not cached as it can operate very quickly on the cached term filters.
* @and@: Generates a term filter (which is cached) for each term, and wraps those in an and filter. The and filter itself is not cached.
* @or@: Generates a term filter (which is cached) for each term, and wraps those in an or filter. The or filter itself is not cached. Generally, the @bool@ execution mode should be preferred.

p. If you don't want the generated individual term queries to be cached, you can use: @bool_nocache@, @and_nocache@ or @or_nocache@ instead, but be aware that this will affect performance.

p. The "total" terms filter caching can still be explicitly controlled using the @_cache@ option. Note the default value for it depends on the execution value.

p. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "terms" : {
                "user" : ["kimchy", "elasticsearch"],
                "execution" : "bool",
                "_cache": true
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>


h1. Caching

p. The result of the filter is automatically cached by default. The @_cache@ can be set to @false@ to turn it off.
