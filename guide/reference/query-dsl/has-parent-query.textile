p. The @has_parent@ query works the same as the "has_parent":has-parent-filter.html filter, by automatically wrapping the filter with a constant_score. It has the same syntax as the "has_parent":has-parent-filter.html filter. This query
is experimental and is available from version @0.19.10@.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "has_parent" : {
        "parent_type" : "blog"
        "query" : {
            "term" : {
                "tag" : "something"
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

h2. Scope

p. A @_scope@ can be defined on the filter allowing to run facets on the same scope name that will work against the parent documents. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "has_parent" : {
        "_scope" : "my_scope"
        "parent_type" : "blog"
        "query" : {
            "term" : {
                "tag" : "something"
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

h1. Memory Considerations

p. With the current implementation, all @_id@ values are loaded to memory (heap) in order to support fast lookups, so make sure there is enough memory for it.
