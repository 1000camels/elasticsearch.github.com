title: Id Field

p. Each document indexed is associated with an id and a type. The id, when indexing, is automatically indexed into an @_id@ field. By default, the @_id@ field is indexed (but *not* analyzed) and not stored. This means that the @_id@ field can be used to query against it.

p. The @_id@ field allows to store it as well, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "_id" : {"store" : "yes"}
    }
}
</pre>
