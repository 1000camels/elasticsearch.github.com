p. elasticsearch provides a full Java query dsl in a similar manner to the REST "Query DSL":/guide/reference/query-dsl/. The factory for filter builders is @FilterBuilders@.

Once your query is ready, you can use the "Search API":search.html.

p. See also how to build "Queries":query-dsl-queries.html

p. To use @FilterBuilders@ just import them in your class:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.FilterBuilders.*;
</pre>

Note that you can easily print (aka debug) JSON generated queries using @toString()@ method on @FilterBuilder@ object.
