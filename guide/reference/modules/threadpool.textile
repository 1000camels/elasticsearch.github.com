p. A node holds several thread pools in order to improve how threads are managed and memory consumption within a node. There are several thread pools, but the important ones include:

* @index@: For index/delete/bulk operations (defaults to @cache@ type).
* @search@: For get/count/search operations (defaults to @cache@ type).

p. Each pool can have a type associated with it, and based on the type, associated parameters. The types can be @cached@, @fixed@, @scaling@, and @blocking@.

p. Changing a specific thread pool can be done by setting its type and specific type parameters, for example, changing the @index@ thread pool to @blocking@ type:

<pre class="prettyprint">
threadpool:
    index:
        type: blocking
        min: 1
        max: 30
        wait_time: 30s
</pre>
